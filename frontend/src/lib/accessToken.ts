/**
 * Memory-only access-token manager (spec §5.6 auth model; PR #4
 * hardening Task 1).
 *
 * Session layout this module owns the client half of:
 * - the LONG-LIVED refresh token never touches JS — it lives only in the
 *   HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax cookie scoped to the auth paths;
 * - the SHORT-LIVED access token rides the login/refresh RESPONSE BODY
 *   and is kept HERE, in one module-level variable, for the tab's
 *   lifetime: `lib/api.ts` attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer …` on
 *   CampusQuest API requests. It is NEVER written to localStorage,
 *   sessionStorage, cookies, or any other persistent store — a page
 *   reload forgets it, and the refresh-cookie rotation below reissues
 *   it (the cold-start bootstrap).
 * - rotation is SINGLE-FLIGHT: concurrent 401 recoveries (several
 *   sections bootstrapping at once) share one in-flight `POST
 *   /auth/refresh`, so N concurrent callers cause exactly one cookie
 *   rotation — one refresh session, one rotation per wave, never a
 *   thundering herd against the rotate-once semantics.
 *
 * The rotation request authenticates by the HttpOnly cookie alone: no
 * `Authorization` header is attached (a stale bearer would be noise, and
 * the CSRF double-submit header is the mutation proof the endpoint's
 * guard wants when the cookie is presented).
 *
 * Server-side imports see an empty store: only browser flows call the
 * setters, so a Server Component reusing `apiRequest` simply sends no
 * bearer (the backend's 401 stays the authority there).
